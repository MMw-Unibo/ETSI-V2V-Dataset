# Dataset description
Each folder contains the dataset produced by running a scenario in artery.

They usually comprise two folders one containing CAM dataset and the other DENM dataset.

The following section describes the attributes provided in each dataset.

# Dataset attributes

## CAM
| COLUMN NAME   | MEANING |
|   ---         |   ---   |
| source        | stationID identifier of the ITS-S that generates the ITS message in question.|
| destination   | destination of the ITS message (null when broadcast).|

|referencePositionLat      | Position measured at the reference point of the originating ITS-S. (Latitude) |
|referencePositionLong     | Position measured at the reference point of the originating ITS-S. (Longitude) |
|referencePositionAlt      | Position measured at the reference point of the originating ITS-S. (Altitudde)|
|simulationTime  (secs)    | It represents the simulation time at which the DENM message is received by an ITS-s. Start is 0.|
|generationDeltaTime       |Time corresponding to the time of the reference position in the CAM, considered as time of the CAM generation|
|isSpecialVehicle          | It may assume True or False depending on the Vehicle type.|
|causeCodeIfSpecial        | It describes the event type of the emergency or safety mission. This DF is included in the containers emergencyContainer and safetyCarContainer in case the originating ITS-S is mounted on a vehicle operating some emergency missions or safety mission, e.g. protecting a convoy of dangerous goods|
|stationType               | Provides the station type information of the originating ITS-S. |

## DENM
| COLUMN NAME   | MEANING |
|   ---         |   ---   |
| source        | stationID identifier of the ITS-S that generates the ITS message in question.|
| destination   | destination of the ITS message (null when broadcast).|
| messageID     |   Type of the ITS message [1]. <br> - (1) **denm**: Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) [2]; <br> - (2) **cam**: Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) [3]; <br> - (3) **poi**: Point of Interest Message [4]; <br> - (4) **spat**: Signal Phase And Timing (SPAT) Message [5]; <br> - (5) **map**: MAP Message [5]; <br> - (6) **vi**: In Vehicle Information (IVI) Message [6]; <br> - (7) **ev-rsr**: Electric vehicle recharging spot reservation Message.|
| actionID      | Event identification. <br> ``stationID:seqNumber`` <br> Sequence number assigned to the *actionID* for each new event. <br> **N.B.** In case of multiple originating ITS-S detect the same event for the first time, the *actionID* should be different in each originating ITS-S.|
|situation_informationQ| Situation information quality.  It indicates the probability of the detected event being truly existent at the event position.|
|situation_eventType| Description for the event type, including direct cause and sub cause. **In this case only direct cause is provided.** See [Cause Code section](#cause-code).|
|location_speed\*       | Moving speed of a detected event and the confidence of the moving speed information.|
|location_heading\*      | The heading direction of the event and the confidence of the heading information, if applicable.
|detection_time\*\*          | Time at which the event is detected by the originating ITS-S.<br> For the DENM repetition, this DE shall remain unchanged.<br> For the DENM update, this DE shall be the time at which the event update is detected. <br> For the DENM termination, this DE shall be the time at which the termination of the event is detected. |
|reference_time             | The referenceTime represents the time at which a DENM is generated by the DEN basic service, after receiving the application request. |
|simulation_time (secs)            | It represents the simulation time at which the DENM message is received by an ITS-s. Start is 0.|
|eventPos_lat               | Geographical position of the detected event (Latitude). |
|eventPos_long              | Geographical position of the detected event (Longitude). |
|eventPos_alt               | Geographical position of the detected event (Altitude). |
|relevanceDistance          | The distance in which event information is relevant for the receiving ITS-S. **Not set in this scenario**|
|termination				| It can assume two values: <br> ``` Termination_isCancellation	= 0, Termination_isNegation	= 1 ``` <br> - **Cancellation**: A DENM that informs the termination of an event. A cancellation DENM is transmitted by the same originating ITS-S which has generated the new DENM for the same event. <br> - **Negation**: A DENM that informs the termination of an event for which the new DENM has been received by the originating ITS-S from another ITS-S. A negation DENM may be used to announce thetermination of an event if the originating ITS-S has the capacity to detect the termination of an event which has been previously announced by other ITS-Ss| 
|stationType\*\*\*                | Provides the station type information of the originating ITS-S.|
|||






<sub>\* In this case only the value is reported (no confidence information) </sub>

<sub>\*\* The parameter referenceTime is the identifier for DENM update referring to a specific actionID. The *referenceTime* represents the time at which a DENM is generated by the DEN basic service, after receiving the application request. For each DENM update, the *referenceTime* shall be updated and the value shall be greater than the *referenceTime* value of
the previous DENM update for the same actionID. The actionID shall remain unchanged for DENM update, as long as the stationID of the originating ITS-S remains
unchanged.</sub>

<sub>\*\*\* In the dataset the stationType is 0, however, the type of the station is vehicle.</sub>
